# Project Debug Rules (Non-Obvious Only)
- Application logs to stderr for visibility in Termux terminal output
- WebDAV connection issues may require checking Android network permissions
- File access errors likely indicate missing Termux storage setup (termux-setup-storage)
- Hash mismatches suggest file corruption during transfer or local modification
